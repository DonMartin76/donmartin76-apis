# DonMartin76 API Portal

This is the configuration of my own API Portal I use for demo purposes.

You won't be able to read out anything useful from here, apart from how some APIs or Authorization Servers may or may not be configured.

As everything secret is very encrypted and I here have not included neither the `.envkey` nor the real certificates, you won't be able to deploy from this directly. But if you want, you can copy and paste from it.

Head over to the main [wicked.haufe.io](https://github.com/Haufe-Lexware/wicked.haufe.io) repository for more information on "wicked good API Management" ;-)
